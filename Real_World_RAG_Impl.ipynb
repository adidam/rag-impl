Problem Description: There are two JMS Servers forming a virtual cluster as in reality they are on independent machines. These servers have identical Queues, and a load balancer farms messages into either of the Queues. \\nAn Integration Server runs on each of these servers and they expect to read and process messages from both the queues, so that if any one of the queue goes down, then the JMSReceiver/Sterling service can continue to read from the other backup queue. \\nIn the service definition of the JMS Receiver component, the Provider URL is a comma-separated entry e.g. Provider URL = JMSServer1, JMSServer2 \\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\n\\n\\nThe product does not support this configuration of comma-separated URL’s for active-active failover.\\n\\n \\n\\n If the JMS Server is outside a cluster, the JMS Receiver Provider URL identifies one machine to which the Integration Server will connect. \\n(This configuration might work, in the sense, some threads might latch on and listen on Queue1, and some threads listen on Queue2. Once this happens, they will stay in that specific pattern/ratio for the lifetime of that Integration Server JVM. However, it is more of a lottery system than logic, the way the threads are farmed out. It therefore is not sensible to depend on this comma-separated URL logic to achieve division of labor between the threads.) \\n\\nThe CORRECT process configuration on how to achieve active-active JMS failover configuration for Integration Server is: Create a clone of the existing service. \\n\\n\\nService 1 will listen on JMSQueue1; \\nService 2 will listen on JMSQueue2. \\n\\nIf for any reason, Queue on JMSServer1 goes down, it is expected that the load balancer that feeds messages knows that Queue1 is down and to start pumping messages to Queue2. \\n\\nWith the new configuration, Service2 will now take the brunt of processing these messages at double the load.\\nTo implement the new configuration modify the existing service from\\n\\n \"JMSReceiver (1, 2) -> XSL -> api ->parse+manipulate+etc -> end”,\\n\\nso that the processing part of the service is a Reusable Service (sync) \\nand \\nService 1 = JMSReceiver (1) -> Reusable SyncService -> End \\nService 2 = JMSReceiver (2) -> Reusable SyncService -> End \\n\\nWhy is failover required for Integration Server scenario? \\n\\n\\nFailover is required in an environment where two separate WAS instances (active-active, separate physical locations) exist, and WAS 1 is brought down, then the Integration services that were using the JMS destination associated with WAS 1 can use the WAS 2 JMS destination instead.\\n\\nHow, then is the failover scenario handled for Integration Servers by the Sterling SCA product?\\n\\nAn Integration Server, by nature, is always in an active-passive mode of failover. Sterling does not provide a setting or a property that can support an active-active failover mode like it does for agents. \\n\\nTo implement the failover scenario for Integration Servers, customers can duplicate the set of services that are running on their current environment and copy it over to the backup environment. Each duplicate service can point to a new queue that will receive the same messages that the original queue belonging to the original service was receiving. This will thus, result in an active-active failover scenario.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhy has Sterling not implemented Integration Server failover mechanism as for Agents through backup Provider URLs?\\n\\nIn case of Agent failover, all the active-active Agents must connect to the same JMS Queue. The JMS queue contains a unique message for each transaction that the Agent has to process. All threads of a particular Agent (across physical servers and JVMs) read off one message at a time from the queue - thus avoiding conflicting/overlapping transactions. \\n\\n\\nHence, the single point of failure in this solution is the Queue itself. If the queue fails, all instances of the agent will fail as well, with no option to handle failovers. To address this problem, Sterling provided a mechanism of assigning backup provider URLs to support failovers. \\nHowever, in the case of Integration Servers, one can pull the same message from multiple queues using duplicate services. Hence, there is a good option present to configure the failover scenario as previously described.\\n\\nWhat are the technical challenges of coming up with failover mechanism for Integration Servers similar to Agent Servers? \\n\\n\\nTechnically, one can configure Integration Servers to read off the backup provider URL in the same manner as Agent Servers. However, some inherent problems go along with it.\\nIn the case of Agent Servers, Sterling did not have a choice but to provide a fix because of the JMS queue being the single point of failure. In case of Integration services, however, one can configure multiple queues to work on incoming messages eliminating queues as a single point of failure. \\n\\nIf the change is to redirect all messages to a backup queue, then configure multiple services to receive from the same queue using individual message selectors. However, this can cause a drag on the system and result in performance issues.\\n\\nIn addition, in future Sterling would like to implement the Message Driven Beans (MDB) mechanism for pulling messages from the queues. Since this involves a third-party established standard for processing queues and the Application Server drives it, Sterling will have minimal control over it.\\n\\nHow can the customers’ best implement the workaround suggested by Sterling? \\n\\n\\nOne does not need to duplicate synchronous services. In this case, the Application Server will take care of the failover scenario. Apply this workaround only to mission-critical, asynchronous services since this is where the business logic will reside. \\n\\nThe best way to achieve the duplication would be abstract the services that contain complex business logic and model them as composite services within Sterling. This will make it easy for customers to get the duplication implemented since the crucial business logic will be independent of the queues narrowing down the components, which need change. Needless to state, this logic needs to be well tested before deployment.\\n\\nAre there any advantages of implementing the workaround as opposed to fixing it similar to Agent Server failover? \\n\\n\\nWith the duplication of the services workaround, customers will get an active-active failover mode as opposed to the active-passive mode when providing a backup provider URL.\\n\\n\\n\\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\\n NFX4092 \\n\\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\\n \\n\\nFunction Area\\n\\n\\nIntegration Server\\n\\n\\nSeverity\\n\\n\\nNormal\\n\\n\\nType\\n\\n\\nNormalFix']\n",
            "  response: The other instance of the multi-instance queue manager may be hanging after a failover because of a logger failure at restart due to missing or damaged logs. This can cause the queue manager to fail to come up on the secondary node and generate errors. To resolve this issue, it is recommended to rename the file `amqalchk.fil` found under `mq\\qmgrs\\qmgrname\\` on the shared drive to something like `amqalchk.fil_OLD` and then restart the queue manager. This action should address the logger failure and allow the queue manager to start successfully after the failover.\n",

Problem Description: There are two JMS Servers forming a virtual cluster as in reality they are on independent machines. These servers have identical Queues, and a load balancer farms messages into either of the Queues. \\nAn Integration Server runs on each of these servers and they expect to read and process messages from both the queues, so that if any one of the queue goes down, then the JMSReceiver/Sterling service can continue to read from the other backup queue. \\nIn the service definition of the JMS Receiver component, the Provider URL is a comma-separated entry e.g. Provider URL = JMSServer1, JMSServer2 \\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\n\\n\\nThe product does not support this configuration of comma-separated URL’s for active-active failover.\\n\\n \\n\\n If the JMS Server is outside a cluster, the JMS Receiver Provider URL identifies one machine to which the Integration Server will connect. \\n(This configuration might work, in the sense, some threads might latch on and listen on Queue1, and some threads listen on Queue2. Once this happens, they will stay in that specific pattern/ratio for the lifetime of that Integration Server JVM. However, it is more of a lottery system than logic, the way the threads are farmed out. It therefore is not sensible to depend on this comma-separated URL logic to achieve division of labor between the threads.) \\n\\nThe CORRECT process configuration on how to achieve active-active JMS failover configuration for Integration Server is: Create a clone of the existing service. \\n\\n\\nService 1 will listen on JMSQueue1; \\nService 2 will listen on JMSQueue2. \\n\\nIf for any reason, Queue on JMSServer1 goes down, it is expected that the load balancer that feeds messages knows that Queue1 is down and to start pumping messages to Queue2. \\n\\nWith the new configuration, Service2 will now take the brunt of processing these messages at double the load.\\nTo implement the new configuration modify the existing service from\\n\\n \"JMSReceiver (1, 2) -> XSL -> api ->parse+manipulate+etc -> end”,\\n\\nso that the processing part of the service is a Reusable Service (sync) \\nand \\nService 1 = JMSReceiver (1) -> Reusable SyncService -> End \\nService 2 = JMSReceiver (2) -> Reusable SyncService -> End \\n\\nWhy is failover required for Integration Server scenario? \\n\\n\\nFailover is required in an environment where two separate WAS instances (active-active, separate physical locations) exist, and WAS 1 is brought down, then the Integration services that were using the JMS destination associated with WAS 1 can use the WAS 2 JMS destination instead.\\n\\nHow, then is the failover scenario handled for Integration Servers by the Sterling SCA product?\\n\\nAn Integration Server, by nature, is always in an active-passive mode of failover. Sterling does not provide a setting or a property that can support an active-active failover mode like it does for agents. \\n\\nTo implement the failover scenario for Integration Servers, customers can duplicate the set of services that are running on their current environment and copy it over to the backup environment. Each duplicate service can point to a new queue that will receive the same messages that the original queue belonging to the original service was receiving. This will thus, result in an active-active failover scenario.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhy has Sterling not implemented Integration Server failover mechanism as for Agents through backup Provider URLs?\\n\\nIn case of Agent failover, all the active-active Agents must connect to the same JMS Queue. The JMS queue contains a unique message for each transaction that the Agent has to process. All threads of a particular Agent (across physical servers and JVMs) read off one message at a time from the queue - thus avoiding conflicting/overlapping transactions. \\n\\n\\nHence, the single point of failure in this solution is the Queue itself. If the queue fails, all instances of the agent will fail as well, with no option to handle failovers. To address this problem, Sterling provided a mechanism of assigning backup provider URLs to support failovers. \\nHowever, in the case of Integration Servers, one can pull the same message from multiple queues using duplicate services. Hence, there is a good option present to configure the failover scenario as previously described.\\n\\nWhat are the technical challenges of coming up with failover mechanism for Integration Servers similar to Agent Servers? \\n\\n\\nTechnically, one can configure Integration Servers to read off the backup provider URL in the same manner as Agent Servers. However, some inherent problems go along with it.\\nIn the case of Agent Servers, Sterling did not have a choice but to provide a fix because of the JMS queue being the single point of failure. In case of Integration services, however, one can configure multiple queues to work on incoming messages eliminating queues as a single point of failure. \\n\\nIf the change is to redirect all messages to a backup queue, then configure multiple services to receive from the same queue using individual message selectors. However, this can cause a drag on the system and result in performance issues.\\n\\nIn addition, in future Sterling would like to implement the Message Driven Beans (MDB) mechanism for pulling messages from the queues. Since this involves a third-party established standard for processing queues and the Application Server drives it, Sterling will have minimal control over it.\\n\\nHow can the customers’ best implement the workaround suggested by Sterling? \\n\\n\\nOne does not need to duplicate synchronous services. In this case, the Application Server will take care of the failover scenario. Apply this workaround only to mission-critical, asynchronous services since this is where the business logic will reside. \\n\\nThe best way to achieve the duplication would be abstract the services that contain complex business logic and model them as composite services within Sterling. This will make it easy for customers to get the duplication implemented since the crucial business logic will be independent of the queues narrowing down the components, which need change. Needless to state, this logic needs to be well tested before deployment.\\n\\nAre there any advantages of implementing the workaround as opposed to fixing it similar to Agent Server failover? \\n\\n\\nWith the duplication of the services workaround, customers will get an active-active failover mode as opposed to the active-passive mode when providing a backup provider URL.\\n\\n\\n\\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\\n NFX4092 \\n\\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\\n \\n\\nFunction Area\\n\\n\\nIntegration Server\\n\\n\\nSeverity\\n\\n\\nNormal\\n\\n\\nType\\n\\n\\nNormalFix']\n",

CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY.', ' FIX README\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n IBM WebSphere Cast Iron appliances in High Availability (HA) configuration may rarely experience internal database corruption during a failover event. The affected databases are used to store projects, configurations, running jobs and job history. \\n\\nThe corruption may occur when an appliance is actively writing data to these databases at the time of HA failover. Typical behavior is that an HA appliance is unable to start or operate normally after an HA failover. \\n\\nCONTENT\\nThe workaround is to empty the database which has been affected. The following commands reset the internal databases, causing them to be re-created in an empty state. \\n\\n\\nsystem clean orchmon\\nsystem clean running\\nsystem clean deploy\\n\\nAlternatively, the command system clean all empties all internal databases and returns the appliance to factory default settings. Note that running \"system clean ...\" commands results in permanently removing contents on the appliances. Care should be taken to ensure proper configuration backups are available for restoring after issuing \"system clean ...\".\\n\\nThe following stated workaround can be used to restore an affected HA appliance, but on its own does not prevent the situation from re-occurring. Cast Iron is providing a firmware fix to alter the way the internal databases are created which prevents the problem from re-occurring. The new settings only take effect when the internal databases are created. Therefore customers who have experienced this behavior in the past or wish to eliminate the possibility of it occurring should follow this procedure:\\n\\n1. Back up the appliance:\\n- In the Command Line Interface (CLI), issue the command config save system ftp [ftphostname] user [username] passwd [userpassword] file [filename].cfg and replace values in square brackets ([]) with custom values.\\n\\n- Or in the Web Management Console (WMC), on the left click \"Repository\" and then \"Import/Export\" and choose to export \"Project and user settings\" to a file.\\n\\n2. Upgrade to a version of the Cast Iron firmware which contains the fix. Announcements of new fix packs and releases are made public on theWebSphere Cast Iron Support Portal [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/WebSphere/WebSphere_Cast_Iron_Cloud_integration].\\n\\n3. Clear the databases with one of following methods:\\n- Issue the command system clean all. Wait a few minutes for the operation to complete. The appliance will reboot when the reset is complete. This command will clear all settings, including network settings, and they will need to be reconfigured again.\\n\\n- Issue the following commands: system clean orchmon, wait until you can log into the WMC again before issuing system clean running, wait until you can log into the WMC again before issuing system clean deploy. Wait until you can log into the WMC again before moving onto the next step.\\n\\n4. Re-enable HA using the commands system haconfig enable ... on both appliances\\n\\n5. Import the backed-up settings using the file from step 1:\\n- In th CLI, issue the command config load system ftp [ftphostname] user [username] passwd [userpassword] file [filename].cfg and replace values in square brackets ([]) with custom values.\\n\\n- Or in WMC navigate to \"Repository\" > \"Import/Export\" and import the file previously exported in step 1.', ' NEWS\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n Fix packs for WebSphere Cast Iron Cloud integration are now available for download. \\n\\nCONTENT\\nFollowing are links to more information about the latest fix packs available on Fix Central for these versions: \\n\\n * 7.5.2.0 (App Connect Professional).

            "document>>>>>>> [' TECHNOTE (FAQ)\\n\\nQUESTION\\n Is the AIX Operating System affected by the leap second adjustment? \\n\\nANSWER\\nOn December 31, 2016, during the last second of the day, a new leap second will be added to global time.\\nAIX does not have -- and never has had -- any direct awareness of the leap second. There have been several leap seconds over the years through the history of AIX, with no known AIX issues reported. However, the NTP (Network Time Protocol) daemon is available on AIX for those who need precise time synchronization with other systems.\\n\\nAIX systems may fall into one of three scenarios:\\n1) Sub-second synchronization not an issue; no NTP in use. The system will run as normal, unaware that its own time is one second offset from where it had been previously.\\n2) System time synchronization needed: use NTP daemon. Your AIX system can run the NTP time service as a client, synchronizing to another system or an external time server (e.g. time.nist.gov). The NTP client will slowly adjust the system clock to stay in sync with the time server, thus accommodating the leap second.\\n3) The AIX system is itself acting as a primary NTP master server, without in turn being a client of another time server. This is rare and not recommended if you need sub-second time synchronization, but if you do need to configure your system in this way, you can do so following the instructions at ntp.org – specifically (as of this writing) http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/ConfiguringNTP#Section_6.14 [http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/ConfiguringNTP#Section_6.14]\\n\\nMost systems will be in scenario #1 or #2 and will not need to take any action.', \" SUBSCRIBE\\nYou can track all active APARs for this component.\\n\\n\\n\\nAPAR STATUS\\n * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.\\n    \\n   \\n   \\n\\nERROR DESCRIPTION\\n *  You execute the following select:\\n   \\n   select ('02/28/2000'::date+3 units year) from systables where\\n   tabid=1;\\n   \\n   and it succeeds.
