            "ORLANDO, Fla. - LSU football certainly woke up feeling the cheesiest on Monday. The No. 16 Tigers (10-4) dominated Purdue (8-6) in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl at Camping World Stadium, 63-7. LSU punted on its first drive and then proceeded to score touchdowns on its next six drives, finishing off the game with a 99-yard interception and score from safety Quad Wilson. A win heavily favored the Tigers after Purdue coach Jeff Brohm had left the Boilermakers for Louisville, star quarterback Aidan O'Connell and wide receiver Charlie Jones opted out of the game to prepare for the 2023 NFL Draft. Regardless, LSU played a nearly flawless game. The Tigers didn't allow any points until the fourth quarter, and by that time they were already up 49-0. Jayden Daniels and Garrett Nussmeier split reps at quarterback for most of the game until freshman Walker Howard finished off the game in the fourth quarter. With a double-digit win total to finish off coach Brian Kelly's first season, the Tigers can head into the 2023 campaign on a positive note, especially with Daniels and the vast majority of the offense returning. After scoring its first touchdown of the game, LSU made a surprising change. Nussmeier, despite Daniels being healthy and playing well on the last drive, replaced LSU's starter at quarterback.\n",

Gregory Clayton fair caught the football at the LSU 18 and the penalty moved the ball to the 33. Nussmeier entered at quarterback on LSU’s third offensive possession of the game.

The model simulates every FBS college football game 10,000 times. Over the past six-plus years, the proprietary computer model has generated a stunning profit of almost $2,500 for $100 players on its top-rated college football picks against the spread.

You can visit SportsLine now to see the model's picks. Here are the college football odds and trends for Purdue vs. LSU:  With receivers Kayshon Boutte (NFL opt-out), Jaray Jenkins (NFL opt-out) and Jack Bech (transfer portal) also out, the Tigers will likely want to lean on the run game to ease the burden on quarterback Jayden Daniels. Junior running back Josh Williams is one player the Tigers can turn to. He leads the team's running backs with 97 carries for 532 yards (5.5 average) and is third with six touchdowns. Williams also has 21 receptions for 132 yards (6.3 average). He has rushed for 100 or more yards in three of the 11 games he's played in.\n",
            "His best game was an 18-carry, 118-yard and one-touchdown performance in a 13-10 win at Arkansas on Nov. 12. In the SEC title game against Georgia, he carried six times for 55 yards (9.2 average), including a 47-yarder. He has been hampered with an ankle injury. Among those leading the defense is senior linebacker Micah Baskerville. He leads the team in tackles with 83, including 39 solo, with one sack for six yards. He also has six pass breakups and one interception he returned for 29 yards and a touchdown. Baskerville has registered nine tackles in each of the last two games, including six solo against Georgia on Dec. 3. He was named to the Butkus Award Watch List for the 2022 season, and was LSU's top returning tackler after finishing second on the team with 83 a year ago. With the Boilermakers' top two pass catchers -- wide receiver Charlie Jones and tight end Payne Durham -- declaring for the NFL Draft, junior wide out TJ Sheffield will look to take advantage of a bigger role on the offense. Sheffield had 39 receptions for 424 yards (10.9 average) and three touchdowns during the regular season. In the Big Ten title game against Michigan, he caught four passes for 54 yards (13.5 average).\n",
            "The Tigers forced a turnover on downs to open the second half as senior linebacker Micah Baskerville nearly intercepted Burton on 4th-and-4 from the Purdue 45. Nabers found Daniels for a 5-yard touchdown pass on a trick play. That marked Nabers’ second passing completion of the game, giving him 50 yards through the air and a touchdown to extend the Tigers’ lead to 42-0. With the receiving score, Daniels also became the only LSU quarterback with a passing and receiving touchdown in the same game since at least World War II. Brooks picked off Alaimo at the Purdue 27 with 9:17 remaining in the third quarter. Nabers added to an already impressive day by taking a jet sweep from Nussmeier 75 yards for a touchdown, extending the LSU lead to 49-0 with 3:15 left in the third quarter. On the second play from scrimmage in the fourth quarter, the Boilermakers got on the board as Alaimo found Sheffield for a 16-yard touchdown to make it 49-7 Tigers. True freshman Walker Howard entered at quarterback for LSU, leading the offense to a seven play scoring drive, culminating in a 12-yard touchdown rush up the middle by Derrick Davis Jr. to extend the lead to 56-7.\n",
            "He immediately started showcasing his arm talent, taking a shot deep to Malik Nabers on his first throw of the game. Like Daniels, he finished the drive with a touchdown. Nussmeier completed 4-of-6 passes on the drive for 39 yards, most notably finding Mason Taylor on third down for 17 yards to get LSU into the red zone. Nussmeier rotated out for Daniels on the next drive which also led to a touchdown. But that drive wasn't his last, as Nussmeier finished the game with 173 passing yards and two touchdowns. His only error came in the third quarter when he threw an interception in the end zone that snapped LSU's six-touchdown streak. But regardless of the result, Nussmeier's early insertion into the game poses an interesting wrinkle for LSU's quarterback's room heading into spring practices. Without three starters on the defensive line and with little to no depth at wide receiver and cornerback, LSU had to shake up its rotations with some new faces even before the game got out of hand in the fourth quarter. On the defensive line, edge rusher Zavier Carter was featured on a few passing downs in the first half while linebacker Mike Jones Jr., who has played limited snaps in the second half of the season, played more with BJ Ojulari opting out for the NFL Draft and Desmond Little in the transfer portal.\n",

The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20. The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16]  The Rams' victory was their second, first as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.\n",

            "The Super Bowl 2023 stadium is ready to host the greatest show on turf. The United States of America: the land of the free, the Super Bowl and some of the greatest sports stadiums the world has ever seen. Brand new behemoths continue to spring up across the land with fresh, state-of-the-art stadiums generally favoured by the NFL to host the Super Bowl in their first couple of years after opening. Last year saw the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles given a starring role after opening in 2020, while the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Atlanta and US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis have each been christened with the Super Bowl in recent times. The new Allegient Stadium in Las Vegas, home to the relocated Raiders, also opened in 2020 but is not scheduled to host the Super Bowl until 2024, meaning another relatively old stadium has leaped in to fill the gap. RadioTimes.com brings you everything you need to know about the Super Bowl stadium in 2023. The Super Bowl will be held in Glendale, Arizona this year. The area last hosted the Super Bowl in 2015, a relatively short space of time to host the event twice. State Farm Stadium – home of the Arizona Cardinals – will host the Super Bowl for the third time in history. It hosted the 2008 and 2015 Super Bowl games under the guise of University of Phoenix Stadium before State Farm assumed naming rights.\n",
            "At Super Bowl LV, it was Tom Brady stealing the show yet again, but for the first time in his career, not while wearing a New England Patriots jersey.  Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. Patrick Mahomes and the elite offense of the Chiefs’ were stymied by the Bucs’ defense, recording zero touchdowns in the big game.  Meanwhile, Brady grabbed his seventh Super Bowl ring by throwing for 201 yards and three touchdowns. He connected with Rob Gronkowski six times for 67 yards and two touchdowns.  Super Bowl LVII is set to take place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., home of the Arizona Cardinals. It will be the fourth Super Bowl hosted in the Phoenix metropolitan area, with the last one coming in 2015 for Super Bowl XLIX.  The 2024 and 2025 Super Bowls are also set. Super Bowl LVIII will be hosted by Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, where the Raiders play, and Super Bowl LVIX will be at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, home of the Saints.\n",
            "Super Bowl XLIV, slated for February 7, 2010, was withdrawn from New York City's proposed West Side Stadium, because the city, state, and proposed tenants (New York Jets) could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with Kaufmann Stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[55] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.  The location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[56]\n",
            "Super Bowl LV also marked the first time in the history of the modern league that a host city's professional football franchise got to play in a Super Bowl that was hosted in their home stadium. The following year saw the Los Angeles Rams defeat the Cincinnati Bengals, becoming the second team to win the Super Bowl in its home stadium.[17]  Super Bowl LVII was held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs. Kansas City overcame a 10 point deficit at halftime to defeat the Eagles 38-35.[18]  Super Bowl LVIII will be held at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada on February 11, 2024.  The Super Bowl is one of the most-watched annual sporting events in the world, with viewership overwhelmingly domestic.[19] The only other annual event that gathers more viewers is the UEFA Champions League final.[19] For many years, the Super Bowl has possessed a large US and global television viewership, and it is often the most-watched United States originating television program of the year.[20] The game tends to have a high Nielsen television rating, which is usually around a 40 rating and 60 shares. This means that, on average, more than 100 million people from the United States alone are tuned into the Super Bowl at any given moment.\n",

            "Concerns about the lack of diversity in the HFPA board and the award nominees were brought up last year, and similar concerns were still brought up this year. Similar to NBC’s stance, many actors were absent in a statement to demand change. Winning actors including Will Smith, Nicole Kidman, Andrew Garfield and Rachel Zegler were not present to receive their awards. While the HFPA has announced new policies for diversity, equity and inclusion, and inducted 21 new members, including several people of color as well as the addition of Neil Phillips as chief diversity officer, the future of the Golden Globes still remains uncertain.

Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, has rejected the claims as \"speculations without any basis, and intended to blame-shift and smear China\".[222]  The United States boycott of China's Winter Olympics was predominantly due to China's human rights issues on topics such as the systematic oppression of the Uyghurs, Tibetans and the riots in Hong Kong in 2019.[223] The Chinese government implemented many coercive activities in those regions, such as the reeducation camps, mass detention camps, and restricted access to social media.  In October 2018, American senator Marco Rubio, Senator Jeff Merkley, and Congressmen Jim McGovern and Chris Smith sent a letter, on behalf of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) requesting the revocation of China's host right on the 2022 Winter Olympics.[224] The letter stated that \"no Olympics should be held in a country whose government is committing genocide and crimes against humanity.\"  In November 2021, President Biden proposed \"a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\n",

It was supposed to host Super Bowl LV, but construction delays derailed that plan. Although Los Angeles originally won one of the bids from the cluster made available of LIII, LIV, and LV, they couldn’t host in 2021. The three Super Bowl hosts were chosen from a four-candidate pool. However, with the delay, all four locations got a spot.\n",

It marks the first time since 2003 that the Super Bowl has not been held on the first Sunday in February. Because of the NFL's expanded, 17-game, 18-week schedule, it will be held on the second Sunday in February. This is the latest that a Super Bowl has ever been held. Super Bowls 44, 50 and 55 all were held on Feb. 7, which was previously the record for the latest Super Bowl. Under the NFL's new format, the latest date on which a Super Bowl can occur is Feb. 14. NBC is set to broadcast the Super Bowl. Al Michael, Cris Collinsworth and the rest of the \"Sunday Night Football\" crew will presumably broadcast the event. NBC's last Super Bowl broadcast came in 2019, when Tom Brady's Patriots beat Jared Goff's Rams 13-3. SoFi Stadium — the home of the Rams and the Chargers — will host the Super Bowl in 2022. Originally, the new stadium, which opened in 2020, was scheduled to host the Super Bowl in 2021.

The Nobel Prize in physics for 2022 is being awarded to Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger for their work on quantum mechanics, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced on October 4, 2022.  The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded “for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities, and pioneering quantum information science,” the academy said. The 2022 physics laureates’ development of experimental tools has laid the foundation for a new era of quantum technology. Being able to manipulate and manage quantum states and all their layers of properties gives us access to tools with unexpected potential.  Intense research and development are underway to utilise the special properties of individual particle systems to construct quantum computers, improve measurements, build quantum networks and establish secure quantum encrypted communication. This year’s Nobel Prize laureate John Clauser built an apparatus that emitted two entangled photons at a time, each towards a filter that tested their polarisation. The result was a clear violation of a Bell inequality and agreed with the predictions of quantum mechanics.\n",

Clauser and Anton Zeilinger were recognized for their experiments in an area that has broad implications for secure information transfer and quantum computing. By Isabella Kwai, Cora Engelbrecht and Dennis Overbye Three physicists whose works each showed that nature is even weirder than Einstein had dared to imagine have been named winners of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. John Clauser, of J.F. Clauser and Associates in Walnut Creek, Calif.; Alain Aspect of the Institut d’Optique in Palaiseau, France; and Anton Zeilinger of the University of Vienna in Austria, will split a prize of 10 million Swedish kronor. Their independent works explored the foundations of quantum mechanics, the paradoxical rules that govern behavior in the subatomic world. In experiments conducted over the last 50 years, they confirmed the reality of an effect that Albert Einstein had disdained as “spooky action at a distance.” Measuring one of a widely separated pair of particles could instantaneously change the results of measuring the other particle, even if it was light-years away. Today, physicists call this strange effect quantum entanglement, and it is the basis of the burgeoning field of quantum information. When the award winners were announced on Tuesday, Eva Olsson, a member of the Nobel Committee for Physics, noted that quantum information science had broad implications in areas like cryptography and quantum computing.\n",

            "So it was that Kupp hauled in the game-winning 1-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford with 1:25 left and became the eighth wide receiver to win Super Bowl MVP -- and the first since Julian Edelman in Super Bowl LIII. Kupp, who was 7-1 to win MVP at Caesars Sportsbook, finished with eight catches for 92 yards and two scores. The second touchdown capped a drive in which Kupp, with the help of Stafford and some savvy tweaks from Rams coach Sean McVay, took over the game. After a quick start, Kupp, who also won the NFL's receiving triple crown by leading the league in receptions, yards and receiving touchdowns, didn't get the ball much. Fellow wideout Odell Beckham Jr. suffered a left knee injury with 3:50 remaining in the first half, and with Beckham out of the game, the Bengals threw everything they had at slowing Kupp.  \"Whatever it is, I just want to execute my job to the best of my ability,\" Kupp said. \"I trust that as the game goes on, I will have opportunities, as well, and I just want to stay ready for those things, stay locked in.\" In their first season as teammates, Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp connected for 22 TDs, including the playoffs. It was the second most by a QB-receiver duo in a season in NFL history.\n",

That doesn't include a 4-yard touchdown in the back of the end zone that was nullified by offsetting penalties (holding on the Rams and unnecessary roughness on the Bengals). \"I don’t feel deserving of this … I don’t know what to say.”  — L.A. Rams star Cooper Kupp wins the Super Bowl MVP, the 8th wide receiver to do so pic.twitter.com/PfvXv0S1te Indeed, Kupp helped create two drive-extending penalties in the game's fateful moments: defensive holding on Logan Wilson on third-and-goal from the Bengals' 8 and defensive pass interference on cornerback Eli Apple two plays later. Donald was similarly impactful on the defensive side of the ball, registering four tackles (two for loss), two sacks and three quarterback hits — including the one that forced an incompletion by Joe Burrow on fourth-and-1, sealing the victory for Los Angeles.\n",
            "A look: After Beckham was hurt, Kupp had just two catches for 22 yards before the Rams' final offensive series. To create chances for Kupp, McVay decided to go with some tempo, eschewing a huddle in hopes of slowing down the Bengals' pass rush and forcing them into more basic zone coverages. Kupp found soft spots in that zone, and Stafford found Kupp. On that final drive, Kupp had four catches for 39 yards, a 7-yard carry for a first down on fourth-and-1 and the winning score. According to Elias Sports Bureau research, Kupp is the second player with four-plus receptions on a go-ahead drive in the fourth quarter or later of a Super Bowl, joining Pittsburgh's Santonio Holmes in Super Bowl XLIII. That came despite the Bengals' best effort to keep Kupp from getting the ball. Before the final touchdown, Kupp drew three straight penalties -- a defensive holding, a defensive pass interference and an unnecessary roughness -- to set up the final score. \"Once we got down in the tight red area, it felt like it was about 60 plays for us to be able to finally get that one in on the fade,\" McVay said. \"And Cooper Kupp is the man.\" Kupp's Super Bowl heroics put the finishing touches on a stellar season in which he cemented himself as one of the league's best players.\n",
            "‘Mission complete,’ but questions about future loom for Aaron Donald, Rams Cooper Kupp was named the MVP in the Rams’ 23-20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals because Kupp had the more spectacular role. But it was Donald, the defensive lineman, who really turned the game, in the same visceral, powerful way that a hydraulic dam stops a river. That play with Burrow wasn’t the last play of the game, but it was certainly the play that ended it. “One last play to be world champs,” as Donald said. One last play. Forty-three seconds left, the Bengals driving at midfield toward a game-tying field goal that would have forced overtime and Burrow showing the showstopper charisma of Young Elvis. For eight years, Donald had been seeking the moment. Eight years of individual awards — of all-pros and Pro Bowls. Three-time defensive player of the year. He had close to a hundred sacks and all kinds of other statistics. But as Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris said, “Stats are for losers, man.” Donald didn’t want any more stats. He wanted the ring, a championship, the one that eluded him three years earlier when the Rams lost to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. “I know what it feels like to be there, but I don’t know what it feels like to win,” Donald said last week. Feeling was what Donald brought to the game as much as anything.\n",

            "Elden Ring[a] is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware. It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.  Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.  During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series. Miyazaki admired the work of Martin, whose contributions he hoped would produce a more accessible narrative than those of the company's earlier games.\n",

From 2015 to 2018, the singer had a hot streak as Male Vocalist, but Combs toppled his reign for two years in 2019 and 2020. Still, in 2022, Stapleton's steady traditionalism and consistency as a live act won the day. Together with his All-American Road Show, the singer has been one of country music's most prolific and reliable touring acts this year, and he is even the subject of a current Country Music Hall of Fame exhibit. Early in the year, he won three Grammy Awards, including Best Country Album for his late 2020 project, Starting Over. The 2022 CMA Awards aired live from Nashville's Bridgestone Arena on ABC.\n",

Johnson has had an incredible touring year, plus the chart-topper “’Til You Can’t,” though that may not be enough for him to beat out category veterans such as Church, Stapleton and Combs.

HARDY has been opening shows for buddy Morgan Wallen and expanding on his country releases with “Sold Out” reaching No. 1 on the Hot Hard Rock Songs chart. He’s also rising on the country chart with “Wait in the Truck,” featuring fellow category nominee Wilson. Meanwhile, the sole female nominee, Wilson, is riding high on an undeniably red-hot career streak right now, with a new album, the previously-mentioned two Country Airplay hits, an opening slot for Jon Pardi and a role on the new season of Yellowstone.

Wilson shared the good fortune of the night with her family, who have been waiting on good news recently. \"A few months ago my daddy got real sick,\" Wilson told the audience. \"We thought we were gonna lose him.

Despite its critical acclaim, Lambert hasn’t had the radio success with Palomino that the other projects have earned, but that shouldn’t detract from the album’s merit. Wilson is the only artist here who also has a nomination in the prestigious song of the year category, but Combs is likely to return to the podium.  \tWill win: Luke Combs  Nicholson: Combs dominated this category in 2020 with What You See Is What You Get, while Lambert previously won for her albums Platinum and Revolution.

Wilson’s six overall nominations in her first year as nominee includes this album of the year nod for Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’, while Old Dominion was previously nominated in the category for their self-titled album in 2020.

            "context>>>>> Apple is set to unveil the all-new iPhone 14 lineup this fall, bringing new features such as an always-on display and upgraded camera hardware. What about the iPhone 14 chip? As it turns out, things are going to be interesting this year. The iPhone 14 chip will be different than the iPhone 14 Pro chip for the first time. As a quick refresher, the iPhone 14 lineup is expected to consist of four different devices across two different screen sizes. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro will feature a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 14 Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max will feature a 6.7-inch display.  This will mark the first time that Apple has offered a non-Pro version of the iPhone with a 6.7-inch display. But with that being said, there will be some key differences between the iPhone 14 models and the iPhone 14 Pro models. This includes the chip inside. Apple has traditionally upgraded the chip inside the iPhone every year. For instance, the iPhone 12 lineup was powered by the A14 chip, while the iPhone 13 lineup is powered by the A15 chip. That won’t be the case this year with the iPhone 14 chip.  According to reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max chip won’t get an upgrade this year.\n",
            "It is identical to the A15 in the previous year's iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max,[26][27] which has more memory and an additional GPU core compared to the A15 in the non-Pro iPhone 13 models.[28][29]  The iPhone 14 was the first flagship model since the 2008 iPhone 3G whose chip was unchanged from the previous year.[26] The Verge's Mitchell Clark attributed the unchanged chip to an attempt to maintain costs during the ongoing chip shortage and inflation surge. Clark also said the A15 \"still outperforms the latest chips from Qualcomm and Google in most benchmarks\", though the older chip may lead to the iPhone 14 receiving fewer updates, similar to what happened with the iPhone 5C from 2013.[26][27]  The iPhone 14 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532 × 1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 14 Plus features a 6.7-inch (170 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2778 × 1284 pixels and a pixel density of about 458 PPI. Both models have typical brightness of up to 800 nits, and a max brightness of up to 1200 nits.[6]\n",
            "The older chip could also keep prices down at a time when inflation is bumping up the cost of other gadgets. While potential iPhone 14 buyers probably won’t have to worry too much about performance — the A15 still outperforms the latest chips from Qualcomm and Google in most benchmarks — there is the question of longevity. While Apple has a great track record when it comes to long-term software support for its phones, I still have to wonder if the iPhone 14’s chip means that it’ll get one or two fewer iOS updates.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

            "The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max feature a new Super Retina XDR display with updated ProMotion technology that allows for an Always-On display, a first for an iPhone. The Always-On display is made possible through a new 1Hz to 120Hz refresh rate along with improved power efficient technologies. When the Always-On display is active, the time, widgets, and Live Activities remain available at a glance at all times, and the wallpaper is dimmed.  In addition to Always-On technology, the iPhone 14 Pro's Super Retina XDR display offers higher peak HDR brightness at up to 2000 nits, which puts it on par with the Pro Display XDR. It offers the highest outdoor peak brightness in a smartphone, and it is twice as bright as the iPhone 13 Pro when in sunny conditions.  There's an updated A16 chip in the iPhone 14 Pro models, and this marks the first time that Apple has used different chips for the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Pro. The A16 is the first chip built on the new 4-nanometer process, bringing speed and efficiency improvements. The A16 has a faster 6-core CPU, an accelerated 5-core GPU with 50 percent more memory bandwidth, and an updated 16-core Neural Engine performs 17 trillion operations per second.\n",
            "Apple added a 48-megapixel Wide camera with a quad-pixel sensor that adapts to the photo being captured, so the detail of a 48-megapixel photo is compressed into a 12-megapixel photo. For most photos, every four pixels are combined into one large quad pixel for even better low-light performance. The 48-megapixel lens also enables a 2x Telephoto mode that uses the middle 12 megapixels for full-resolution photos with no digital zoom. This joins the existing 3x zoom enabled by the dedicated Telephoto lens, which has also been improved.   The iPhone 14 Pro models are able to shoot at the full 48MP with ProRAW, enabling the new iPhones to take impressive professional photos. Second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization reduces shake and blur, and a new 12 megapixel Ultra Wide camera has larger pixels for sharper images with more details and a better macro mode. The TrueDepth front-facing camera has an improved f/1.9 aperture for better low-light selfies and videos, and it supports autofocus for the first time. The Adaptive True Tone flash has been redesigned with an array of nine LEDs that change pattern based on the lens focal length. Features like Night mode, Smart HDR 4, Portrait Mode, and Photographic Styles continue to be available.  Apple's A16 chip powers a Photonic Engine that improves low-light performance across all of the lenses in the iPhone 14 Pro models.\n",
            "iPhone 14 Pro pricing starts at $999 for 128GB of storage, while pricing on the iPhone 14 Pro Max starts at $1,099 for 128GB of storage. Additional storage is available for a higher price. The iPhone 14 Pro models can be purchased from the online Apple Store, Apple retail locations, and third-party retailers. Reviews of the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max were positive, highlighting the major new feature such as an always-on display with a new Dynamic Island, upgraded cameras with a 48-megapixel main lens, car crash detection and satellite connectivity for emergencies, the A16 Bionic chip for faster performance, and new Deep Purple and Space Black color options. Emergency SOS via Satellite is not launching until November, so the feature was not available for review at the time. Exclusive to the iPhone 14 Pro models, the Dynamic Island replaces the traditional notch found on all iPhone 13 models. Aided by software, the cutout morphs into different shapes and sizes for things such as incoming phone calls, alerts, notifications, Face ID authentication, timers, turn-by-turn navigation, Live Activities, and more. While the Dynamic Island is certainly more useful than the notch on previous iPhones, The Verge's Nilay Patel said the feature's potential is not fully realized yet, as it currently only supports third-party apps that use the Now Playing or CallKit APIs.\n",

While the yearly event is primarily targeted at developers, there will be plenty of fun stuff for enthusiasts and the general public. Google usually doesn’t reveal much about what it plans to announce at the event. However, the company has now released the Google I/O 2022 schedule, giving us a brief overview of what to expect. Google I/O 2022 will be held on May 11 and May 12 at the Shoreline Amphitheater. The event will kick off with Sundar Pichai’s “Google I/O keynote” at 10 AM. This will be the main attraction for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services, Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home devices. The main keynote will be followed by the Developer keynote and “What’s new in Android.” This is where we expect to learn more about Android 13, Wear OS, and updates to developer products and tools. Google says the schedule is slightly different this year.\n",
            "A message from our CEO May 11, 2022 min read [TL;DR] Nearly 24 years ago, Google started with two graduate students, one product, and a big mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. In the decades since, we’ve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission. The progress we've made is because of our years of investment in advanced technologies, from AI to the technical infrastructure that powers it all. And once a year — on my favorite day of the year :) — we share an update on how it’s going at Google I/O. Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them. Thank you to everyone who helps us do this work, and most especially our Googlers. We are grateful for the opportunity. - Sundar  Editor’s note: Below is an edited transcript of Sundar Pichai's keynote address during the opening of today's Google I/O Developers Conference. Hi, everyone, and welcome. Actually, let’s make that welcome back! It’s great to return to Shoreline Amphitheatre after three years away. To the thousands of developers, partners and Googlers here with us, it’s great to see all of you.\n",

Ten films competed to take home the most prestigious award in film, the Oscar, with the winner revealed when The Oscars aired LIVE SUNDAY, MARCH 27 on ABC. The nominees for Best Picture were: BELFAST, CODA, DON'T LOOK UP, DRIVE MY CAR, DUNE, KING RICHARD, LICORICE PIZZA, NIGHTMARE ALLEY, THE POWER OF THE DOG and WEST SIDE STORY. THE POWER OF THE DOG had the most nominations, having been nominated for 12 Academy Awards. NIGHTMARE ALLEY was the fourth Best Picture nomination for Bradley Cooper, having previously been nominated for AMERICAN SNIPER (2014), A STAR IS BORN (2018) and JOKER (2019). WEST SIDE STORY was Steven Spielberg's 11th Best Picture nomination, which is a record for an individual producer.

It won over Belfast, Don’t Look Up, Drive My Car, Dune, King Richard, Licorice Pizza, Nightmare Alley, The Power of the Dog, and West Side Story. The film won in all three categories in which it received nominations. Troy Kotsur won Best Supporting Actor—the first deaf man to win an Oscar for Acting—and the film also won Best Adapted Screenplay. Eight categories were moved out of the live broadcast of the Oscars this year, including Editing, Original Score, Makeup and Hairstyling, and Production Design. The change in proceedings prompted some dissatisfied responses from industry members who felt that the move minimized the creative accomplishments of many departments responsible for a movie’s success.

            "Advertisement Supported by The complete list of winners for the 94th Academy Awards. By Gabe Cohn The 94th Academy Awards were held on Sunday night at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood. “CODA,” a relatively small-scale drama once considered an underdog, won the award for best picture, becoming the first film distributed by a streaming service to win Hollywood’s top honor. (“CODA” was released by Apple TV+, which purchased the movie after it played at the Sundance Film Festival in 2021.) The night’s most awarded movie was “Dune,” which won in six categories including cinematography and production design. The best director honor went to Jane Campion, whose subversive western, “The Power of the Dog,” was the most nominated movie of the night. Campion’s victory was important for Oscars history: This year’s ceremony became the first time that the best director Oscar has gone to women twice in a row. (Chloé Zhao won last year for “Nomadland”; Campion had already made history by being the first woman to be nominated for best director twice.) Will Smith (“King Richard”) won the best actor category; Jessica Chastain (“The Eyes of Tammy Faye”) won for best actress. Ariana DeBose (“West Side Story”) received the best supporting actress award, becoming the first openly queer woman of color to win an acting Oscar.\n",
            "The 94th Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), took place on March 27, 2022, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The awards were scheduled after their usual late February date to avoid conflicting with both the 2022 Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LVI, with the latter being held in nearby Inglewood, California.[3] During the gala, the AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories honoring films released from March 1 to December 31, 2021. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Will Packer and Shayla Cowan and was directed by Glenn Weiss.[4] Actresses Regina Hall, Amy Schumer, and Wanda Sykes hosted the show for the first time.[5] Two days earlier, in an event held at the Ray Dolby Ballroom of the Ovation Hollywood complex in Hollywood, the Academy held its 12th annual Governors Awards ceremony.[6]  CODA won three awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included Dune with six awards, The Eyes of Tammy Faye with two, and Belfast, Cruella, Drive My Car, Encanto, King Richard, The Long Goodbye, No Time to Die, The Power of the Dog, The Queen of Basketball, Summer of Soul, West Side Story and The Windshield Wiper with one.\n",

            "WATCH LIVE Troy Kotsur, Ariana DeBose made Oscars history with their acting wins; Beyonce opened with performance 2022 Oscar winners' acceptance speeches LOS ANGELES -- The Academy Awards named the deaf family drama \"CODA,\" best picture Sunday, handing Hollywood's top award to a streaming service for the first time in a ceremony that saw the greatest drama when Will Smith strode onstage and slapped Chris Rock. While Jane Campion's \"The Power of the Dog,\" with a leading 12 nominations, seemed like the frontrunner for the Oscars' top prize, Sian Heder's \"CODA\" rode a wave of goodwill driven by its cast including Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur, Emilia Jones and Daniel Durant. It's the first film with a largely deaf cast to win best picture.  Kotsur also won best supporting actor to become the first male deaf actor to win an Oscar, and only the second deaf actor to do so, joining his castmate and \"CODA\" co-star Matlin. Many, though, were talking about another moment. After Rock, as a presenter, joked to Jada Pinkett Smith that he was looking forward to a sequel to \"G.I. Jane,\" Will Smith stood up from his seat near the stage, strode up to Rock and smacked him. After sitting back down, Smith shouted at Rock to \"keep my wife's name out of your (expletive) mouth.\n",
            "And she made history as well, becoming the first Afro-Latina and openly LGBTQ actor to win in the category. \"To anybody who has ever questioned your identity,\" she said, echoing more lyrics from \"West Side Story,\" \"I promise you there is a place for us.\" \"Belfast\" \"CODA\" - WINNER \"Don't Look Up\" \"Drive My Car\" \"Dune\" \"King Richard\" \"Licorice Pizza\" \"Nightmare Alley\" \"The Power of the Dog\" \"West Side Story\" \"Belfast\" Kenneth Branagh \"Drive My Car\" Ryusuke Hamaguchi \"Licorice Pizza\" Paul Thomas Anderson \"The Power of the Dog\" Jane Campion - WINNER \"West Side Story\" Steven Spielberg Jessica Chastain in \"The Eyes of Tammy Faye\" - WINNER Olivia Colman in \"The Lost Daughter\" Penélope Cruz in \"Parallel Mothers\" Nicole Kidman in \"Being the Ricardos\" Kristen Stewart in \"Spencer\" Javier Bardem in \"Being the Ricardos\" Benedict Cumberbatch in \"The Power of the Dog\" Andrew Garfield in \"tick, tick...BOOM!\n",

            "The win for deaf family drama ‘CODA’ marks the first time a streaming service took Hollywood’s biggest prize. “CODA”, the heartwarming movie about a deaf family with a hearing daughter, has won the prestigious best picture prize at the Oscars. Sunday’s win for CODA marked the first time a streaming service took home the film industry’s biggest prize. “CODA” was released by Apple TV+, which beat Netflix Inc’s contender “The Power of the Dog” and other entries from traditional Hollywood studios. Lady Gaga and Liza Minnelli presented the award to the film, which follows teenage Ruby – who can hear – as she juggles pursuing her musical ambitions with her family’s dependence on her to communicate. Deaf actors feature in several lead roles. “I really want to thank the academy for recognizing a movie of love and family at this difficult time that we need today,” producer Patrick Wachsberger said in front of the film’s cast stood on stage. “CODA” managed to take home the coveted prize despite being one of the least-nominated films with only three coming into Sunday. Not since 1932’s “Grand Hotel” has a movie won best picture with fewer than four nods. Earlier, a 94th Academy Awards that steadily maintained a buoyant spirit was rocked when best actor winner Will Smith slapped presenter Chris Rock onstage over a joke about the actor’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.\n",

            "“Everything Everywhere All at Once,” a twisty sci-fi adventure, led the nominations for the 95th Academy Awards on Tuesday morning, picking up 11 nods. It was followed closely behind by “All Quiet on the Western Front,” a World War I epic, and “The Banshees of Inisherin,” a darkly comic look at friendship that unfolds against the backdrop of the Irish civil war, both of which scored nine nominations.  \tAll three films will vie for best picture, in what is shaping up to be a much more commercially-successful collection of honorees than recent years. The best picture race contains the two highest-grossing films of the year, “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Top Gun: Maverick,” along with “Elvis,” a musical biopic that scored with audiences last summer. Other contenders include Steven Spielberg’s semi-autobiographical “The Fabelmans”;”Tár,” a drama about an abusive conductor; “Women Talking,” a look at the residents of a repressive religious community; and “Triangle of Sadness,” a send-up of the 1% that unfolds partly on a mega-yacht.   \t               \t“Triangle of Sadness,” one of the most divisive films of the year, had a strong showing on Tuesday morning, capturing nominations for his screenplay and for the direction of Ruben Östlund, the Swedish filmmaker who dreamed up the satire.\n",
            "On the morning of the ceremony, however, it was reported that Gaga would perform at the ceremony.[36] Meanwhile, actress Glenn Close, who was originally scheduled as a presenter during the gala, canceled her appearance due to a positive COVID-19 test.[37]  When the nominations were announced, nine of the ten films nominated for Best Picture had earned a combined gross of $1.57 billion at the American and Canadian box offices at the time. Top Gun: Maverick was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $718.7 million in domestic box office receipts.[38] Avatar: The Way of Water came in second with $598.4 million; this was followed by Elvis ($151 million), Everything Everywhere All at Once ($70 million), The Fabelmans ($15 million), The Banshees of Inisherin ($9 million), Tar ($5.6 million), Triangle of Sadness ($4.2 million), and Women Talking ($1.1 million). The box office figures for All Quiet on the Western Front were unavailable due to their distributor Netflix's policy of refusing to release such figures.[39] Furthermore, by virtue of Avatar: The Way of Water and Top Gun: Maverick's Best Picture nominations, it marked the first time since the 55th ceremony in 1983 that the two highest grossing films of the year were both nominated in the aforementioned category.[40]\n",

            "It will surprise few people and interest fewer to hear that the motion picture academy’s choice for best picture of the year was a far cry from my own. That happens most years anyway, and it’s long been the prerogative (some would say the obligation) of film critics and Oscar voters to disagree. And from the moment it appeared on the scene, “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s frenzied mashup of immigrant fable, martial-arts spectacular, cosmological slapstick and multiverse-spanning group hug, has provoked more than its share of disagreement. Did I say disagreement? More like the kind of rancor that can thrive only in the hothouses of social media, where a movie about the importance of kindness somehow provokes some of the more hostile cinephile debates in recent memory. Had Daniels, as Kwan and Scheinert bill themselves, thrillingly rejuvenated the motion-picture medium, or had they turned out something so exhaustingly frenetic as to verge on unwatchable (at least in one sitting)? In concocting a genuine word-of-mouth theatrical hit (with more than $100 million worldwide, it’s by far A24’s biggest success), had they singularly disproved the theory that Hollywood originality is dead, or had they inadvertently confirmed it by making a derivative Marvel-adjacent superhero movie in indie drag?\n",
            "He will compete for the director prize against Spielberg, Todd Field (“Tár”), Martin McDonagh (“The Banshees of Inisherin”), and the directing duo of Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”). It’s a category dominated entirely by men. The last two best director winners, Jane Campion (“The Power of the Dog”) and Chloe Zhao (“Nomadland”), have been women, and there were some hopes that “Women Talking’s” Sarah Polley might nab a best director nod.  \tThe nominations were announced at a challenging time for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, the non-profit behind the awards, and the film business itself. Ratings for the Oscars have declined precipitously in recent years, imperiling the broadcast’s licensing fees, the leading source of revenue for the Academy. At the same time, adult-oriented movies such as “The Fabelmans,” “Tár” and “The Banshees of Inisherin” have struggled at the box office during the pandemic. Exacerbating the situation is the fact that streaming services, which helped fill the void left by the decline in theatrical revenues by providing a platform (and a blank check) for the artists behind them, are also shifting their priorities. Netflix, for instance, has signaled to Wall Street that it will keep content spending relatively flat while it focuses on increasing profits.\n",

            "But everyone loves a comeback story, and this year’s Oscar season has included several of them. Ke Huy Quan, a former child actor best known for his work in “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” earned a best supporting actor nomination for his work in “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” A few years ago, Quan had given up on acting, convinced that his career in front of the camera was over. There’s also Brendan Fraser, a former action star whose career was derailed by health issues and personal struggles, but who has re-emerged as a powerful character actor with a transformative turn as a morbidly obese man in “The Whale.” He earned a nomination for best actor.  \tBoth Fraser and Quan will spend the morning fielding congratulatory calls. Others won’t have much to celebrate. That’s because many of the year’s most heralded performances, a group that includes Viola Davis in “The Woman King,” Brad Pitt in “Babylon” and Danielle Deadwyler in “Till,” failed to make the final crop of contenders.   \tAnd there were some surprise inclusions, perhaps none more stunning than Andrea Riseborough, whose performance as an alcoholic woman in the little-seen indie “To Leslie” scored her a best actress nomination.\n",

Follow the latest entertainment news here or read through the updates below. From CNN's Lisa Respers France The 95th Academy Awards definitely wasn't like last year's ceremony – and for that, the people behind the scenes are probably breathing a sigh of relief. After \"the slap,\" the Academy instituted a crisis team that was on hand to make sure things didn't get out of hand. But Sunday night was devoid of that type of drama – and of many surprises. As expected, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" was a big winner, taking home the awards for best actress, supporting actor and actress, best original screenplay, best picture and best directing categories. Brendan Fraser bested Austin Butler for best actor, which wasn't exactly an upset as they were both leading contenders. The closest thing that came to a shocker was Sarah Polley's win for best-adapted screenplay for \"Women Talking,\" a small film that felt very much the David that beat out the Goliath of a blockbuster, \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" in the category. All of this meant the show was allowed to let the talent and their heartfelt speeches shine.  From Ruth E.\n",

Barty became the first Australian to win the event since Chris O’Neil captured the women’s title in 1978. O’Neil was present in the stands cheering as the crowd on the flooodlit Rod Laver Arena erupted when Barty converted her first match point with a forehand crosscourt winner. When Collins appeared to be on the verge of levelling the match as she served at 5-1, the Australian showed nerves of steel and raised her game. Barty got the set back on serve and then dominated the tiebreak to complete a memorable comeback that left the home nation rejoicing all over Australia. We have the winner now. Ashleigh Barty wins her first Australian Open title after beating Danielle Collins in the women's singles final by 6-3 7-6. After losing four consecutive games, Collins finally wins one.

            "She has won so many 6-0 sets this year — a “bagel” in tennis parlance — that the saying “Iga’s bakery” was coined. Swiatek’s surge to the top came at an opportune time. In March, Ashleigh Barty of Australia, a three-time Grand Slam singles champion and the world No. 1, abruptly retired at 25 years old, saying she had accomplished all she wanted in the sport and was ready for a new challenge. In her departure, Barty, then the reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champion, left a significant void in women’s tennis, which has largely been a free-for-all in recent years. No woman has won more than two Grand Slam titles in a calendar year since Williams won three in 2015. Since late 2020, Swiatek has done all she can to bring some order to women’s tennis, winning three of the past 10 Grand Slam titles. Beyond her dominance on the court, Swiatek has assumed a leadership role off it. She has spoken out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine more than any player who is not from Ukraine and has helped raise more than $2 million for relief efforts through her participation in tennis exhibitions, one of which she organized herself. “We’re trying to do our best to be good people,” she said during the trophy ceremony, as red-and-white Polish flags swung throughout the stands.\n",

Arguably the most anticipated Grand Slam on the tennis calendar, the Melbourne tournament has everything and this year won't be different. Ranging from interactive activities to some of the biggest names in the world, the Australian Open doesn't disappoint. Looking back, the 2022 event was nothing short of outstanding. Australian Ash Barty broke a 44-year-old record to claim her first Grand Slam on her home turf. While Rafael Nadal - who notched his 21st Grand Slam - remarkably came back from two sets to love to defeat 2021 US Open (tournament before Aus Open) champion Daniil Medvedev. Here's how it played out. Barty came into the tournament ranked no.1 in the world and knew what it took to win a Grand Slam. Having previously won at Wimbledon (2021) and the French Open (2019), the Queenslander wanted to take home the prize that meant the most: a trophy on her home soil. Despite the pressure of expectation to take out the 2022 championship, Barty's form never wavered throughout the two weeks, resulting in no sets lost. In the final, the Australian came up against American, Danielle Collins, who she had the reign over in previous battles.\n",

It was a match of historic proportions for both players: Nadal was attempting to surpass an all-time record of 20 major men's singles titles, shared with rivals, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, by winning a record 21st major title, and to become the fourth man to complete the double career Grand Slam (after Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and Novak Djokovic), while Medvedev was seeking to become the first man in the Open Era to win his first two major titles at consecutive events (having won the 2021 US Open title).  Nadal defeated Medvedev, 2–6, 6–7(5–7), 6–4, 6–4, 7–5, in 5 hours and 24 minutes to win his second Australian Open title, and a then all-time record 21st major men's singles title. This was the second-longest major final in history after the 2012 Australian Open final, in which Nadal also participated.[1] Nadal became the first player in the Open Era to win an Australian Open final after losing the first two sets, and the first to do so since Emerson in 1965.\n",

            "Advertisement Supported by The 24-year-old Belarusian player pushed Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan to three sets to capture her first Grand Slam singles title. By Matthew Futterman Reporting from Melbourne, Australia Aryna Sabalenka is no longer afraid of big stages. Overcoming a history of buckling under the pressure of late-round Grand Slam tennis, Sabalenka, the powerful 24-year-old from Belarus, came from behind to beat Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the women’s singles final of the Australian Open on Saturday. In a matchup of two of the biggest hitters in the sport, Sabalenka was a little more fearless and a few clicks more clinical than Rybakina in the crucial moments to cap off a dominant summer of tennis in Australia. It was Sabalenka’s first Grand Slam title in a rocky career that has included the kind of error-ridden, big-moment meltdowns from which some players almost never recover. Instead, the match proved a microcosm of Sabalenka’s career — a shaky start, filled with ill-timed double faults followed by a steadying midmatch recovery before a final-set display of raw power and precision that her opponent could not answer. And it all went down after Sabalenka decided last year to make a contrarian move in an era when athletes train their minds as hard as they train their bodies.\n",

I am looking forward to coming back next year,\" said Sabalenka, 24, as she held the trophy. \"It was a good year for me and hopefully next year I am going to have the same result and (do) even better.\" Big-hitting Sabalenka beat Magda Linette in the semi-finals and kept up her record of not dropping a set during the tournament. Rybakina had been similarly impressive, defeating world number one Iga Swiatek and fellow Slam winners Jelena Ostapenko and Victoria Azarenka, on her run to the final. And it was the Kazakh player who secured the first break of serve to lead 2-1 before her opponent broke back to level at 4-4. And Rybakina broke again to leave 5-4 before holding serve to love to take the opening set.\n",

It is her third Grand Slam title and first on a surface other than clay. By Matthew Futterman The 2022 U.S. Open will always be remembered — outside of Poland, at least — for its farewell to Serena Williams, long the queen of tennis and the greatest women’s player ever. Beware, though, after Poland’s Iga Swiatek won the women’s singles title Saturday, beating Ons Jabeur of Tunisia Saturday afternoon at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the sport may have a new ruler on its hands. Swiatek, the world No. 1, lived up to her billing and beat Jabeur, 6-2, 7-6(5), to capture her first U.S. Open singles title. It was the third Grand Slam title of Swiatek’s brief career and her first on a surface other than clay. When Jabeur’s last forehand sailed long, Swiatek collapsed on her back after a 1 hour, 51 minute duel that got dangerously close as the afternoon wore on.\n",

She has been frank about the possible outcomes here, including the fact that losing is an option that should be prepared for, one that would not be a tragedy. Quite the final we have on Philippe Chatrier today, a battle between an irresistible force in Iga Swiatek and irresistible charm in Coco Gauff. It’s also a battle between two members of the younger generation on the women’s tour. Swiatek, the 2020 French Open champion, while Gauff is still just 18, having charmed the tennis world in 2018 with her Wimbledon run. It’s her first grand slam final, though she has also reached the women’s doubles final this year at Roland Garros. To land the French title, Gauff must beat a player on a 34-match winning streak, going for a sixth title in succession, and therefore upset the odds, though she has yet to drop a set this year in Paris. This could be a classic, and three sets of tennis must be expected. We start at 2pm UK time.\n",
